# Final Bootstrapping Version

With the base syntax implemented and the ability to reference external files, it's now possible to assemble a version from the main codebase. Unlike previous steps in the bootstrapping process, the script produced takes no arguments. When run, it will produce a full version of the `tome` executable, after which you should be capable of running `tome build`.
