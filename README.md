# Tome: Large Scale Literate Programming

Tome is a literate programming tool aimed at serving large scale projects. It's primarily an idea in my head right now, but here's a sketch of the features I want to provide:

* [ ] Written in Markdown so most code hosting sites render it natively
* [ ] Operates on directories rather than individual files
* [ ] Varying forms of inclusion to serve more flexible requirements
* [ ] Book based organization, with directories being chapters
* [ ] Validation and linting
* [ ] Prose critique (maybe by a large language model?)
* [ ] First class support for testing
* [ ] Text editor support
* [ ] Language agnostic

There's a lot more floating around in my head, but I'm going to focus on getting an intial version before returning to this summary.

## Table of Contents

Ultimately, I think it would be a good idea if this was dynamically generated somehow. That might be tricky if I want to keep it in the readme, but maintaing a list of links to other files gets quiet tedious even on small projects. Just something to think about for now, though.
