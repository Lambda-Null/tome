# Future Work

Here's a collection of various ideas to explore for this project:

* Syntax to force macro to be one line (useful when the condition of an `if` is involved)
* File defining order of sections and chapters
* Bootstrap files get generated by main project
* Lint markdown files, especially link legitimacy
* Spell check
* Libraries in other Tome projects pulled in by URLs
* Syntax for defining the lines immediately preceding a macro expansion (not sure, but could help define a function that is called in the `if` statement immediately following it)
* Pipeline to ensure bootstrapping still works
  - Generated by docs and checked in
  - Also a job to ensure that the generated pipeline matches the in use pipeline
* Blocks within documentation that are dynamically expanded, such as table of contents
* Macros defined with `(...):` require multiple definitions
* Examples as unit tests
* Make the executable more portable using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/)
* Help text generated from markdown file
* Text editor extensions
* Some form to reduce duplicated lines, such as the same thing being imported
