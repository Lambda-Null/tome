# Project Structure

In order to provide a richer set of features, Tome expects the project to be structured in a particular way. Here's what's covered in this chapter:

* [Section 1 - Project Context](1_Context.md)

## The `.tome` Directory

The top of a Tome project is identified by a directory called `.tome`. When commands like `build` run, they use the presence of that directory to identify what files need to be acted on. Any executables in `.tome/commands` will be used as [custom commands to the CLI](/1_CLI/README.md#project-commands).

Rather than write any files under `.tome` directly, those files are typically generated by Markdown files. Any path within a Tome project is a valid target to be written to, so targeting paths within this directory enables allows these commands to be part of the general documentation.

It may be tempting to add `.tome` to the `.gitignore` for the repository, but the directory's presence is important for normal operation. Also, although the commands are generated by Tome, it's not necessarily desirable to require somebody to run `build` before they do anything else after cloning the repository. For example, Tome itself defines a `dependencies` command, without installing those dependencies the parsing logic of the `build` command would be missing a library.

## The `build` Directory

While it's valid to write files anywhere in a Tome project, a directory called `build` alongside the `.tome` directory has special meaning. In general, Tome only creates files, but [the build command](/1_CLI/2_Build.md) removes the `build` directory to ensure that any files no longer being generated don't survive to cause problems.

This directory should be added to `.gitignore`, and if the project was establashed with [the init command](/1_CLI/1_Init.md) it will be automatically.
